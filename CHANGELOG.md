# ðŸŽ´ Chromatic Canvas Changelog

## Version 1.0.1

- *Internal* - Added proper `InteractionLayer` for the module.

## Version 1.0.0

This module was part of [OIF](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/object-interaction-fx), which got the functionality from [Kandashi's Fluid Canvas](https://github.com/kandashi/kandashis-fluid-canvas) (MIT license before someone says something). My original intention was to keep this code contained inside **OIF** forever, but as I've developed new module ideas, making this functionality into a standalone module makes more sense now.

- *API* - Added [`screenShake()`](https://docs.rpgmadesimple.com/FVTT-ChromaticCanvas/#/apiReference?id=screen-shake)
